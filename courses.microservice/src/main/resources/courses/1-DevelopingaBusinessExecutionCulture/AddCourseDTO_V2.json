In this journey, you will first learn how to write and run JUnit tests and identify the right situation to construct and use mock object. The journey continues by discovering how Jakarta Enterprise Edition (JEE) offers a straightforward and comprehensive approach to building state-of-the-art enterprise applications that enables you to create rich web-based interfaces using Java Server Faces (JSF) and effectively construct business logic using Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB). Finally, the journey takes you deeper into the Spring framework where you gradually progress from the Spring principles, Inversion of Control and Aspect Oriented Programming to the Database Integration using ORM frameworks such as JPA & Hibernate, Spring Data JDBC, and Spring Data JPA.
